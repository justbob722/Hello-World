# Hello-World
A long-winded bio

My name is just Bob, and I was born 7/22, therefore justbob722!
I am semi-retired do to medical issues, and thought I would get
back into the world of programming. Back in the late 70s and early
80s, I started in BASIC and fooled with machine language abit.
Became an expert in windows 3.1 and Toolbook. Worked as a macro
programmer in Lotus 123 and early Excel. 
     Got out of the industry to make serious money as a truckdriver. 
Loved it so much that after 4 years on the road, I bought my own truck,
a Volvo VNL 660. Was able to take my family with me during summer 
breaks so my kids got to see the entire country, some of Canada, 
and some of Mexico. drove that truck almost a million mile before 
it gave out. Came off the road to be there as my kids got ready to 
enter high school, so I could go to all their plays, concerts, 
competitions, etc. 
     Got back into community theatre (I had been in several musicals 
late in high school and early college before I dropped out to enter 
the world of computers). Went back to college at the age of 42 to finish 
my degree in music, and start a second degree in math (I loved 
Calculus, of all things) 
     Had several heart attacks, but 3 stents later, was better.
Started moving my family to the land of my childhood, Hawai'i, but 
midway through (I had found employment driving again, this time 
forklifts and box-trucks; I had also found a home) my wife decided 
to end our journey together through life and stayed in Texas...
Several years later, found that 2 disks in my neck had arthritis
and was pinching my spinal cord causing nerve damage that affected
my legs, making standing and walking difficult. To add to the problems,
also found out that I had stage 2 cancer. Lost my employment, and no
one would hire me, so forced into semi-retirement. 
     Decided it was time to use my mind again to make money, so got
into the bitcoin/altcoin game. Next logical step was to get back into 
programming, so here I am!
